Mongo-GLib 0.2.0                                                     2012-06-28
===============================================================================

  • MongoClient has been renamed MongoConnection.
  • MongoConnection connect and disconnect functions have been removed.
  • MongoConnection lazily connects to Mongo once necessary. If disconnected,
    it will reconnect to the server.
  • MongoConnection queues requests until connection is made.
  • Upon failure to reconnect to a replica set, other seeds or discovered
    nodes will be connected to in an attempt to locate the PRIMARY.
  • MongoConnection performs an exponential backup upon connection failure.
  • MongoConnection uses mongodb:// URI format.
  • MongoConnection checks replica-set to ensure it matches upon connection.
  • mongo_bson_dup() returns NULL if bson is NULL.
  • MONGO_BSON_ITER_HOLDS*() macros for checking field types.
  • Improved documentation.

Mongo-GLib 0.1.14                                                    2012-06-13
===============================================================================

  • Increase allowed document size to 16 MB in MongoBsonStream.
  • Fix a memory leak in MongoBsonStream leaking the read buffer
    on each call to mongo_bson_stream_next().
  • Add helpers for using MongoObjectId instances in a hashtable, including
    mongo_object_id_equal() and mongo_object_id_hash().
  • Get access to raw bytes of MongoObjectId with mongo_object_id_get_data().
  • Make mongo_protocol_fail() public.

Mongo-GLib 0.1.12                                                    2012-05-21
===============================================================================

  • Use mongo_simple_async_result_complete_in_idle() to complete async results
    with fewer allocations and locks taken. Improves main loop latency by
    about 20%. [http://audidude.com/?p=605]
  • Build system cleanup.
  • mongo_bson_append_object_id() takes a const MongoObjectId.
  • Be more precise with endianness swabbing.
  • Add mongo_bson_join() to join to BSON documents.
  • Passing NULL to mongo_object_id_copy() will return NULL.
  • Add mongo_query_flags_get_type().

Mongo-GLib 0.1.9                                                     2012-05-09
===============================================================================

  • Initial release of Mongo-GLib
  • Support for non-deprecated BSON protocol.
  • Support for connecting to a mongo server and performing queries,
    inserts, updates, and deletes.
  • Basic error checking of commands, queries, and other operations.

  This is an initial protoype version. There are many things missing such as
  reconnect support, master detection in a replSet, gridfs support, and
  documentation. The missing gtk-doc will make using this from GObject
  introspection a bit difficult for the time being.
