Mongo-GLib 0.1.9                                                     2012-05-09
===============================================================================

  • Initial release of Mongo-GLib
  • Support for non-deprecated BSON protocol.
  • Support for connecting to a mongo server and performing queries,
    inserts, updates, and deletes.
  • Basic error checking of commands, queries, and other operations.

  This is an initial protoype version. There are many things missing such as
  reconnect support, master detection in a replSet, gridfs support, and
  documentation. The missing gtk-doc will make using this from GObject
  introspection a bit difficult for the time being.
