        Mongo-GLib - A Mongo Driver for GObject Based Applications
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a work-in-progress driver that uses GLib and GObject to implement
a Mongo driver and BSON reader and writer. It can be used via GObject
introspection, making it available to JavaScript via GJS, Python, Vala,
and other languages.

This driver is not optimized at all.
