        Mongo-GLib - A Mongo Driver for GObject Based Applications
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a work-in-progress driver that uses GLib and GObject to implement
a Mongo driver and BSON reader and writer. It can be used via GObject
introspection, making it available to JavaScript via GJS, Python, Vala,
and many other languages[1].

This driver is not optimized at all. However, the difference in approach
between the python bson module and MongoBson yields anywhere from about
4x to 25x faster. This is because the bson python module builds a SON that
requires all the data to be build first. MongoBson is instead implemented
as a builder (meaning less memory consumption too). Take a look at
examples/bson_tests.py.
