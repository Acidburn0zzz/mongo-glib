          Mongo-GLib - A Mongo Driver for GObject Based Applications
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a work-in-progress driver that uses GLib and GObject to implement
a Mongo driver and BSON reader and writer. It can be used via GObject
introspection, making it available to JavaScript via GJS, Python, Vala,
and many other languages[1].

   0: STUFF THAT IS MISSING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mongo-GLib currently lacks a lot of features. For example, the following needs
to be implemented in the short term.

  - Auto-reconnect to Mongo server upon connection being lost. Current
    commands in flight should be completed with an error.
  - Discovery of replSet from Mongo server. This can help us reconnect
    to a host that is master faster than iterating through seeds. However,
    it is only needed when slave-okay is False.
  - Support for sort ordering.
  - Support for creating indexes.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   I. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mongo-GLib works in an asynchronous fashion since most GObject-based
applications already use a main-loop such as GMainLoop. We have also taken
the philosophy that errors should always be reported. Therefore, you wont see
things like the "safe" parameter often seen in other drivers. We always call
getlasterror to check for an error. This is usually not an issue since we
pipeline the data and are asynchronous already.

Each of the asynchronous functions has a corresponding finish function just
like how GIO works. For example, to connect to a Mongo server, you need to
provide a callback to mongo_client_connect_async() that calls
mongo_client_connect_finish().

For example:

  static void
  connect_cb (GObject *object, GAsyncResult *result, gpointer user_data)
  {
    MongoClient *client = MONGO_CLIENT(object);
    GError *error = NULL;
  
    if (!mongo_client_connect_finish(client, result, &error)) {
      g_error("%s\n", error->message);
      g_error_free(error);
    }
  }

  static void
  connect()
  {
    MongoClient *client;
  
    client = mongo_client_new();
    mongo_client_add_seed(client, "localhost", 27017);
    mongo_client_connect_async(client, NULL, connect_cb, NULL);
  }

  II. CODE OVERVIEW
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The basic gist of using Mongo-GLib can be shown by the object design below.

  mongo-bson.h:        Routines for creating, reading, and traversing
                       BSON documents.
  mongo-bson-stream.h: Read and write files containing a sequential list
                       of BSON documents, such as those created by mongodump.
  mongo-client.h:      Primary object for accessing a remote Mongo server.
  mongo-protocol.h:    Implementation of the Mongo wire protocol.
  mongo-object-id.h:   Routines for ObjectId's, a 12-byte object identifier.
  mongo-database.h:    Object reprsenting a database on the Mongo server.
  mongo-collection.h:  Object representing a collection within a database.
